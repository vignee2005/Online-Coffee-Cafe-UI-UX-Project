The *Online Coffee Cafe* website provides an interactive platform to showcase various offerings and services of the cafe, utilizing a responsive Bootstrap template. The homepage (index.html) introduces the cafe with a navigation menu linking to the About, Our Coffees, and Contact sections. Each section is uniquely designed to enhance user engagement. The about.html page highlights the cafe's history and values, while the services.html page showcases a variety of coffee options available. The contact.html page offers users a way to connect with the cafe for inquiries or feedback. The site incorporates modern web design elements, such as a fixed header, light and dark theme toggle, and a responsive layout. Additional features include a search popup for quick navigation and a prominent "Buy Now" button for easy access to purchasing options. This cohesive design ensures a seamless browsing experience across devices, embodying the spirit of a modern coffee loverâ€™s paradise.
